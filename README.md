# Clean code challenge

This is a project targeted to improve or test your understanding of clean code.

## Explanation

In the `src/` folder you will find code that will act as a serializer.
It will transform data from a mock database and enrich some properties with
additional data just as a relational database would do.

### Example

```typescript
const SOURCE_DATA = {
  speakerId: 1
}

// Will be transformed into

const TARGET_DATA = {
  speaker: {
    name: "Some Name",
    topics: ["Some Topic"]
  }
}
```
